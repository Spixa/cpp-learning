# C++ Learning
Things I have worked, learned and experimented with.

*** 

## /src/
Goto the src file to see the source files.  
Every folder includes a README to explain what the folder is about  
Folders at `/src/` contain single files that need to be compiled individually  
However folders at `/src/*/` are project directories which require you to  
compile them together if you ever want to compile them.

## Commits
Commit titles either begin with: + - * which mean `added`, `removed` or `modified`  
And if they end with (!) it means that there were more changes  and the most important change is the title
Descriptions also have + - *
