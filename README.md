# C++ Learning
Things I have worked, learned and experimented with.

*** 

## /src/
Goto the src file to see the source files.  
Every folder includes a README to explain what the folder is about  
Folders at /src/ contain single files that need to be compiled individually  
However folders at /src/*/ are project directories which require you to  
compile them together if you ever want to compile them.
