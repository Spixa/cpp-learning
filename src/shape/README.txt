		Things related to shapes 
	
	Note:
Compile each program IN THIS FOLDER individually since they contain multiple
main.cpp's.
	 
	
	Programs:
		*shape_info.cpp
			Command line arguments:
				./program <amount of lines in the shape> <0 or 1>
					First argument:
						The amount of lines this shape contains (any integer above 2)
					Second argument:
						isShapeRegular(): If the shape is regular
			Usage:
				Enlists some information about the shapes
			Output:
				Shape internal angle
				Shape single internal angle (if its regular)
				Shape external angle (if shape is regular)
			Why:
				idk lol I studied this in math today and I taught it would
				be cool if I coded it in C++ and made it automated
